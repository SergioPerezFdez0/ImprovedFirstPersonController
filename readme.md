The original Unity package provides the following features:

- Input System: Pre-configured to handle movement, looking around, jumping, and sprinting.

- Character Controller: Three scripts that handle player movement and interaction.

- Player Input: A dedicated script for processing player input actions.

### What's Added?

This improved version includes several enhancements and additional features, such as:

- Expanded Input System:

    - Attack functionality

    - Possibility to convert sensitivity from famous games

    - Interaction key

    - Ground angle detection

    - Automatic sliding on steep slopes

    - Crouching

- On-Screen Crosshair: Added for improved aiming and gameplay experience.

- Code Optimization: The original scripts have been refined for better readability and performance.

- Cinemachine Upgrade: Updated to the latest version (3.1.2), which includes major changes in classes and script structures.

- Improved Prefab configuration.

### What's Removed?

Certain features from the original package have been removed to streamline and optimize the experience:

- Arrow Key Movement: Removed to prioritize modern control schemes.

- Analog Control for Gamepads: Removed for a simplified input handling approach.

- UI Canvas overlays for mobile (Joystick and Touch Zone).

- Playground Scene and level prototyping Prefabs.

### How do I bring the sensitivity from other game into Unity?

- Change SensitivityConvertion inside the FirstPersonController to use the desired game's sensitivity system.
- Use a simple rule of 3 to translate some of the listed below SensitivityConvertion examples to a different game by getting the same sensitivity in [Same Aim](https://www.mouse-sensitivity.com/)

- Here's some SensitivityConvertion values for some games:
- CS:GO / APEX LEGENDS: <code>0.436</code>
- VALORANT: <code>1.387</code>
- FORTNITE: <code>0.11</code>
- CALL OF DUTY MWIII / MWII / WARZONE 2.0: <code>0.131</code>

Example: I myself have a CSGO sensitivity of 2.3625 so in Unity I have that sens in CameraSensitivity and 0.436 as SensitivityConvertion.
If I wanted to use my Valorant sensitivity inside Unity, now I should put 0.743 as CameraSensitivity (obtained by using [Same Aim](https://www.mouse-sensitivity.com/)) and 1.387 as SensitivityConvertion.
If I wanted to get the SensitivityConvertion of Overwatch, I would go to [Same Aim](https://www.mouse-sensitivity.com/), get my sensitivity in that game (7.88) and apply a rule of 3, getting as 0.131 Overwatch's SensitivityConvertion
